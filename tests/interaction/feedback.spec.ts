/**
 * feedback.spec.ts = Feedback Spec
 *
 * @summary
 * Checks the interaction feedback rule on every page state, in whichever
 * engine the project runs. Every reachable link and button has to look
 * different hovered than at rest, pressed than hovered, and focused than
 * unfocused, and every form field focused than unfocused, and every property
 * each of those changes, on it or anything inside it, its shadow layers
 * included, has to be eased by a transition, its focus ring included. Each
 * kind of element with a state that switches on and off, such as the phone
 * menu's toggle or Contact's sending button, is flipped off, on, and off again
 * by its attribute, and has to look different and ease each change both ways.
 * On the Home, Work, and About states, the cards that lift on hover without
 * being links have to show and ease their hover, and on the Home and Work
 * states a project card's overlay has to show and ease in when its first link
 * takes keyboard focus. The first keyboard stop, the skip link, has to draw
 * its ring at full width. Under reduced motion every change stays but switches
 * at once. Real clicks are blocked during the checks, so pressing a control
 * never navigates or closes anything mid-check. The snapshot and comparison
 * helpers live in tests/support/feedback.ts. Adapted from the-bernie-bears'
 * own feedback spec.

		expect( await curPagObj.evaluate( () => getComputedStyle( document.activeElement as Element ).outlineWidth ) ).toBe( '2px' ); // What: Full Ring Assertion. Why: The ring has to reach its full width. How: This reads the focused stop's outline width, which the large border width token snaps to 2px. // What: Type Assertion Note. Why: activeElement types as possibly null. How: The Tab press just put focus on a stop.

	test( `${ staRecObj.ideStr } keeps feedback without motion under reduced motion`, async ( { page : curPagObj } ) => { // What: Reduced Motion Feedback Test. Why: Visitors who ask for less motion still need to see their actions register. How: This probes every reachable link, button, and form field, each reachable element of the toggle kinds listed for the state, on the Home, Work, and About states every card, and on Home and Work every project card overlay, with reduced motion on, and checks it finds no problems.


		test.setTimeout( 600000 ); // What: Test Timeout Call. Why: Probing every control's hover, press, and focus takes about two seconds per control, and the Work page's dozens of project links and filters ran WebKit past 90 seconds even before the toggles and cards joined. How: This gives the test ten minutes.

		await curPagObj.emulateMedia( { reducedMotion : 'reduce' } ); // What: Reduced Motion Emulation. Why: The preference has to be set before the page loads. How: This makes the page match prefers-reduced-motion: reduce.

		await opeStaFun( curPagObj, staRecObj ); // What: State Open Call. Why: The controls are probed with the state settled. How: This loads and settles it.

		await curPagObj.evaluate( cliBloFun ); // What: Click Block Call. Why: Pressing a control shouldn't navigate or close anything. How: This cancels every click from here on.


		const proLisArr = [ ...await feeProFun( curPagObj, staRecObj.ideStr, true ), ...await togProFun( curPagObj, staRecObj.ideStr, true ) ]; // What: Problem List Array. Why: Every reachable link, button, and form field has to respond, and every switched state show, without moving. How: This gathers both probes' problems, so a failure prints each one, the toggles' included when a control fails.


		if ( /^(home|work|about)-/.test( staRecObj.ideStr ) ) proLisArr.push( ...await hovProFun( curPagObj, true ) ); // What: Card Probe Call. Why: The cards show, with nothing covering them, only on the Home, Work, and About states. How: On those pages' desktop and phone states, this adds the cards' problems.



		if ( /^(home|work)-/.test( staRecObj.ideStr ) ) proLisArr.push( ...await oveProFun( curPagObj, true ) ); // What: Overlay Probe Call. Why: The project cards, and the overlays holding their links, show only on the Home and Work states. How: On those pages' desktop and phone states, this adds the overlays' problems.



		expect( proLisArr ).toEqual( [] ); // What: No Reduced Motion Problems Assertion. Why: Every probe has to find its feedback without motion. How: This compares the problems with an empty list, so a failure prints each one.
