/**
 * menu.spec.ts = Menu Spec
 *
 * @summary
 * Checks the phone menu's layer behavior in whichever engine the project
 * runs. While the menu is open, the page behind it is dimmed by a scrim and
 * inert, so keyboard and screen reader users stay in the bar, and the menu
 * offers the page links, z4nta0's two profiles, and the contact email. The
 * usual ways out each close it and give the page back: tapping the scrim,
 * pressing Escape, which also returns focus to the toggle, tapping the brand,
 * which also goes home, and widening the screen past the phone layout, which
 * hides the toggle. Choosing any of its links closes it too, whether the link
 * opens in place or in a new tab, through a plain tap, a Ctrl or Cmd click, a
 * middle click, or a plain tap on a profile that opens another site. The email
 * link hands its address to the visitor's mail app rather than a tab, so its
 * plain tap and modified clicks are checked only for closing the menu and
 * leaving the page where it was.
