 * The accessibility checks axe-core can't make, run on every page state in
 * whichever engine the project runs. Names: every link and button in the
 * accessibility tree has a name, and no name carries a decorative glyph such
 * as an arrow or an emoji, and a link that opens a new tab says so. Keyboard:
 * no element uses a positive tabindex, and a Tab walk from the top of the page
 * reaches its end without getting trapped, never moves backwards through the
 * document, and lands only on stops that are on screen, not covered by
 * anything else, and visibly changed by focus. Reflow: at 320px wide, WCAG's
 * narrowest reflow width, nothing scrolls sideways. Motion: with reduced
 * motion requested, nothing animates or transitions for longer than 1ms from
 * the moment the page starts loading, and nothing is left running or waiting
 * once the state has opened. A failing names, keyboard, or motion check lists
 * the problems it found, most of them by element.

/**
 * keyProFun = Keyboard Problems Function
 *
 * @summary
 * Walks the page with the Tab key from wherever focus rests once the state has
 * opened, the top of the page unless the state's action moved focus, and
 * returns every problem: any element with a positive tabindex, which overrides
 * the document order, and every stop that comes earlier in the document than
 * the stop before it, sits off screen, is covered by something else, or looks
 * the same focused and unfocused. The walk ends when focus leaves the page,
 * comes back to the first stop, or stays on the same stop after a press, which
 * is how Firefox leaves its last stop; one that hasn't ended within
 * TAB_MAX_NUM presses counts as a keyboard trap, and one that ends before
 * reaching any stop is a problem too. Since a trap that cycles back to the
 * first stop or holds focus on one stop ends the walk the same way, every
 * element from the first stop on that {@link tabStoFun} says Tab should reach
 * but the walk never did is a problem as well. WebKit only tabs to links with
 * Alt held, the way Safari does by default, so the walk presses Alt+Tab there.
 * It expects reduced motion already requested, so the page jumps to each stop
 * instead of gliding and focus styles appear at once, and each press waits for
 * scrolling to settle, so every stop is measured where and how it ends up.
